# prework-study-guide

## Description

I am excited to begin learning Full Stack development and what it takes to develop my own website. I am eager to improve upon my prior prgramming knwoledge and prepare myself for real world applicaitons of software. I am motivated be my dream of one day becoming a software engineer for a company. The goal of this project was to set up my learning environment for the Coding Bootcamp course and gain fundamental knowledge of Git, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I habe learned how each component, JS, CSS, and HTML all play a unique role in developing a website, starting with the bare framework in HTML, styling in CSS, and finally the functionality and finishing touches in JS.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
